The City Library Digital Management System is a Java-based application used to digitize library operations.
It efficiently manages books, members, and book transactions like issuing and returning.
The project is built using Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as classes, objects, and encapsulation.
Java File Handling is used to store library data permanently in text files.
The system ensures that book and member records remain available even after the program exits.
It uses a simple, menu-driven interface for easy interaction by the librarian.
Main classes include Book, Member, and LibraryManager, structured using Java packages for clarity.
Collections like HashMap and ArrayList allow fast, flexible management of records.
Book IDs and Member IDs are auto-generated to avoid manual entry errors.
Users can search books by title, author, or category.
Sorting functionality allows arranging books alphabetically based on their title.
The project demonstrates real-world usage of Java I/O, OOP concepts, and collection-based data handling.
It is suitable for beginners to understand how Java works with files and collections in a practical scenario.
